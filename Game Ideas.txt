I want to make a game where pirates and ninjas from the 1500s can face off against each other in solo or team battles. 

Make it a game that's open world and you can craft certain items and weapons.

Allow the player to customize their character and dojo/pirate ship.

Add a skill tree so that players can develop certain skills to gain an edge over competition.
